We're excited to include the **Estimate scan** details for a query with pay-per-search data, which allows you to get insights into the amount of data scanned to run the query. Also, to help mitigate the cost, you can view the scan estimates while you create/modify monitors and scheduled searches. [Learn more](/docs/manage/partitions/flex/estimate-scan-data/).
